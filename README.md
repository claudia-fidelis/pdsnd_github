### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, i used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:

* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics related to:

* Popular times of travel
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User info

We also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an **interactive experience** in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
I used the following files:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
